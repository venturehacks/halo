# Adding a new Icon

If you'd like to add a new Icon to the set available on Halo, you need to do the following:

1. Add the `.svg` file to the `src/components/icons` directory.

2. Run the command `yarn icons` (this will explicitly export the icon + add to documentation).

3. Run `yarn dev` and confirm that the new icon shows up as expected [locally](http://localhost:8000/icons).

4. Create a new Pull Request and get approval to merge the changes.

[Here](https://github.com/venturehacks/halo/pull/140) is a link to the Pull Request where we added our current core set of Icons.
