# Breakpoints

In the interest of best practices in responsive design, the handset viewport should be considered first. Developers should strive to apply as few breakpoints as possible. While not prohibited, it is frowed upon to use `*-down` mixins.

### üëç Encouraged mixins

- **`tablet-up`**
- **`desktop-up`**
- `widescreen-up`
- `superwidescreen-up`

### üëé Discouraged mixins

- `*-only`
- `*-down`

## Usage

Row layout that stacks vertically on constrained viewports.

```scss
.component {
  @include flex-column;

  @include desktop-up {
    @include flex-row($valign: stretch);
  }
}

```

### Source

```scss
$handset-breakpoint: 400px;
$tablet-portrait-breakpoint: 720px;
$desktop-breakpoint: 1136px; // minimum to support the full Halo grid
$widescreen-breakpoint: 1440px;
$superwidescreen-breakpoint: 1800px;

@mixin handset-only {
  @media (max-width: $handset-breakpoint) {
    @content;
  }
}

@mixin tablet-only {
  @media (min-width: $handset-breakpoint + 1px) and (max-width: $desktop-breakpoint - 1px) {
    @content;
  }
}

@mixin tablet-up {
  @media (min-width: $tablet-portrait-breakpoint) {
    @content;
