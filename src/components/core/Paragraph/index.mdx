# Paragraph

Handsome, semantic body copy. Implements a subset of common [text interfaces](/constants/text).

The Paragraph component is ideal for rendering blocks of copy. It offers a narrower subset of features from Span, with stronger default enforcement of type size and line height. By default, it applies a natural document flow bottom margin.

We have a following sample paragraph here to illustrate the natural bottom margin flow.

### Usage
